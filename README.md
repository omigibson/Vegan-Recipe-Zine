This is a simple vegan recipe zine, where me and my friends (or anyone that wants to join in on the fun :stuck_out_tongue:) can read and add recipes. There is no CMS, the back end is handled with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/https://firebase.google.com/), and the front end is built with React.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Routing is done with [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
